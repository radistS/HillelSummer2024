for assertions if standard junit 4.x in not enough.

Current behaviour
Phone number may contain plus sign in the beginning, spaces, braces (if there is opening brace there should be closing),
dashes, eg:

// international format 11 digits
0. normalise number: remove all unesessary characters
1. number < 11 or number > 11 - incorrect number
37061234567
+37061234567
+370(6)1234567 +370(6)1234567
+370 612 34 567
+370-612-34-567

Currently supported counties:

Lithuania (LT ISO country code) (370)
Latvia (LV ISO country code) (371)
Estonia (EE ISO country code) (372)
No other symbols except mentioned ones are expected to be passed (e.g. no letters, not #Â±~, etc), no null values are
passed, no empty strings.

Lithuania
Mobile phone number starts with 6 and total has 8 digits excluding phone calling code, e.g. 3706XXXXXXX.

Latvia
Mobile phone number starts with 2 and total has 8 digits excluding phone calling code, e.g. 3712XXXXXXX.

Estonia
Mobile phone number starts with 5 and total has 7 or 8 digits excluding phone calling code, e.g. 3725XXXXXX or 3725XXXXXXX.

To be done
Add support for Belgium (phone calling code is 32, country ISO code is BE). Mobile phone numbers have
9 digits and start with 456, 47, 48 or 49.

For example 32456123456 and +32456123456 is considered to be valid number.
